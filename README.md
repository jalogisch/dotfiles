dotfiles
========

just another dotfile repo, inspired by [dotfiles](http://dotfiles.github.com/) and [michael smalley](http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/) this is my part. 


after cloning
=============

after clone of the repo and running the **install.sh** you need to initialise [janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus) with *rake* in the in *~/.vim*. You might also wish to configure your *vimrc.after* and *vimrc.before*.
